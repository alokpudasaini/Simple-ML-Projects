# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Network
This project implements a simple fully connected neural network with one hidden layer to classify handwritten digits from Kaggle's MNIST dataset.  
The network is built from scratch using NumPy without any deep learning libraries.

## Features

- Input pixel normalization
- One hidden layer with sigmoid activation
- Softmax output layer for multi-class classification
- Cross-entropy loss function
- Backpropagation and gradient descent for training
- Training loss printed every 100 epochs
- Final training accuracy calculation
- Plot of cost vs. epochs

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas

Install dependencies via:
pip install numpy pandas


---

## Usage
 
1. Run the Python script:
python digit-recognition.py


---

## Future Improvements

- Implement ReLU activation function  
- Add validation/test set evaluation  
- Use mini-batch gradient descent or SGD  
- Experiment with more hidden layers and neurons  
- Add saving/loading of trained weights
